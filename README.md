# Meshtastic map
Node application to receive Meshtastic node coordinates via serial port and display them on a webmap.

This is a hobby and spare time project which I work on as my time allows. I publish it in case it's useful for somebody.

2022-08-17: I have just dug the app out again after a year break. Doing updates and bugfixes at the moment. Documentation and containirization are coming (hopefully) soon.
